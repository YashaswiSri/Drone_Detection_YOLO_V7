# Drone_Detection_YOLO_V7
Drone detection refers to the process of identifying the presence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones within a specific airspace. This technology has become increasingly important in recent years due to the growing popularity and use of drones for both civilian and military purposes. With the increasing usage of drones, there is a growing concern over the potential risks they pose, such as privacy invasion, malicious activities, and collisions with other aircraft. It is a critical security measure to prevent unauthorized drone activities like espionage, smuggling, and terrorism. Drone detection technology employs a variety of methods, including radar, acoustic sensors, and video cameras. These systems are integrated with software algorithms to accurately detect and track drones in real-time. This paper primarily focuses on real-time drone detection using deep learning methods to detect real-time UAVs. For the anti-drone system, we are using the YOLOv7 algorithm. Our experiment has shown that the YOLOv7 model produces better accuracy and maintains high detection speed.
